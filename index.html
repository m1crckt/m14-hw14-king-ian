        <h2 class="mt-4">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        First and foremost, I am a music lover. I spend a lot of time creating playlists, collecting MP3 files and vinyl records, and DJing. I also make music from time-to-time using the DAW, Ableton. Additionally, I’m a film lover. I’ve been obsessed with film from the time I was 3 years old. The first movie I saw in the theater was <em>Monster’s Inc.</em> and my Mom tells me I was on the edge of my seat the entire time with my eyes glued to the screen; I believe her. I’m an avid gym-goer as well. Lately I’ve been really into weightlifting, but I also do my best to go on runs a couple times a week. I love going out with my friends here in Tampa to nice restaurants, thrift shops, local markets, and breweries/bars (from time to time). Pickleball is my latest obsession and I try to play at least once every other week.
        <h2 class="mt-4">Aspirations</h2>
        I would like to excel at my current job and move up the ranks to eventually become the official in-house web designer. In this role, I would design new features, components, and specialized pages. This is a step up from my current position, in which I maintain the existing company website and operate within its already-built framework. I enjoy the job and steward it well, but I would like to get more creative in this position and be trusted as a visual designer. I would also one day like to start my own business — ideally that would be a coffee shop/bar/music venue of some kind. For now, I’m focused on finishing my master’s degree, performing at my job, and DJing in my local area and eventually streaming my sets online.
